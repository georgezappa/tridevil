# tridevil

My first attempt to create a webgl project with three.js
I've just started by adding some example code from three.js
I added support for babel7, nodejs, npm, yarn.

## Setting up the project tooling

- using jest for testing
  - travis for continuous intigration
- babel for transpilation
- rollup
- node and npm to gather dependencies

## Using threejs for WEBGL stuff

This will be a simple demo project to see if I can get
all of the tooling configured and a project to execute.
